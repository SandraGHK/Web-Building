		<h1>Life As A Working Mom</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Trying to wash at least four loads of laundry. Daily. While folding none of it.</li>
			<li>Deciding to make a home-cooked meal for dinner. Five minutes in, takeout it is.</li>
			<li>Remembering what color clothing is for tomorrow at school, while forgetting where the car keys are.</li>
			<li>Daydreaming of a nap.</li>
			<li>Stubbing toe OR impaling foot on one of a few hundred toys laying about.</li>
			<li>Keeping a 9-5 for her sanity.</li>
			<li>Wine is the preferred adult beverage over H2O.</li>
			<li>Falls asleep with kids...not on purpose, just because she is so damn tired.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Important Things</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Time with Children</li>
			<li>Sleep whenever possible</li>				
			<li>No one cares if your house is a mess</li>
